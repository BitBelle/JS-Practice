# The Document Object Model

When we open a web page, the browser retrives the page's HTML text and parses it. The browser builds up a model of the document's structure and uses this model to draw the page on the screen.

This representation is one of the toys JavaScript has available in its sandbox. Its a data structure that one can read and modify. It acts as a live data structure: when its modified, the page on the screen is updatedto reflect the changes.
