            <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily for web development.
                Its official name is ECMAScript, but it's commonly known as JavaScript due to its origins. JavaScript was originally
                called LiveScript but was renamed for marketing reasons, leveraging the popularity of Java at the time.

            <h2>Interesting Facts about JavaScript</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scripting Language:</strong> JavaScript executes code at runtime, making it dynamic and flexible.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-side Language:</strong> JS runs in web browsers, interacting with servers to fetch and display information on webpages.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Variables Section -->
        <section id="variables">
            <h2>Understanding JavaScript Variables</h2>
            <p>
                A variable in JavaScript is like a container that stores values. We can declare variables using <code>let</code>,
                <code>const</code>, or <code>var</code>. Each has its own scope and rules. Here's a simple explanation:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>let:</strong> A variable declared with <code>let</code> is limited to the block in which it's defined (block-scoped).</li>
                <li><strong>const:</strong> Variables declared with <code>const</code> are block-scoped and can't be reassigned after initialization.</li>
                <li><strong>var:</strong> The older way of declaring variables, <code>var</code> is function-scoped and can lead to unexpected results due to its hoisting behavior.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: Understanding Scoping with <code>let</code></h3>
            <p>
                Here's an example of how <code>let</code> works in terms of scoping:
            </p>

            <pre>
function letScoping() {
    let a = 10;

    if (true) {
        let a = 20;
        console.log("Inside if block: " + a); // Output: 20
    }

    console.log("Outside if block: " + a); // Output: 10
}

letScoping();
            </pre>
            <p>In the above code, the variable <code>a</code> inside the <code>if</code> block is a separate variable from the one outside due to block-scoping.</p>
